  abstract = {In this work a new technique for anti-slip
control in railway vehicles is proposed. This technique is based on a new parametrization of the unknown adherence force. The control philosophy is alternative to the ones currently implemented in the industry and found in the literature, and aims at enhancing vehicle performances by estimating the maximum available adhesion force, which is then exploited via a nonlinear controller. The effects of the implemented control scheme are the use of the maximum available deceleration in case of poor adhesion conditions and, consequently, a reduction in the wear rate of the rolling stock. The results are illustrated via simulation.}

@article{Colaneri2014a,
abstract = {This paper deals with the optimal control of a class of positive switched systems. The main feature of this class is that switching alters only the diagonal entries of the dynamic matrix. The control input is represented by the switching signal itself and the optimal control problem is that of minimizing a positive linear combination of the final state variable. First, the switched system is embedded in the class of bilinear systems with control variables living in a simplex, for each time point. The main result is that the cost is convex with respect to the control variables. This ensures that any Pontryagin solution is optimal. Algorithms to find the optimal solution are then presented and an example, taken from a simplified model for HIV mutation mitigation is discussed. Crown Copyright ?? 2014.},

abstract={Control of emissions in gasoline engines has become more stringent in the last decades, especially in Europe, posing new and important problems in the control of complex nonlinear systems. In this work a preliminary investigation is conducted on the idea of exploiting Iterative Learning Control to optimize calibration maps that are commonly used in the Engine Control Unit of gasoline engines. In this spirit, starting from existing maps, we show how to refine them using a gradient-descent iterative learning control algorithm, considering additional constraints in the optimization problem. The outcome of this procedure is a control signal which can be integrated in a modified map. The performance of the proposed technique is validated on the provided training signal and cross-validated on different reference signals. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the approach.},
